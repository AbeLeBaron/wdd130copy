        We are local owners who are invested this community. Our goal is to
        make out customers also fall in love with this area just as we have 
        and give them a break with people you love! Enjoy the wrap around 
        porch and two balconies over looking Port Gamble Bay.
        In the evenings enjoy beautiful sunsets over the forest on the other
        side of the bay and in the morning fall in love with the fog that 
        clings to the trees across the water. Explore the shore down the 
        steps and harvest some oysters for dinner!

      <h3>Attractions</h3>
      <p>
        Gamble house offers many attractions that are sure to keep everyone occupied.

        This house is on a dead end street and it is sooo quiet and so dark out 
        at night for star gazing on the balcony. The yard is so big, you'll 
        never finish exploring all her secrets. We love grabbing the binoculars 
        and catching the daily action on the bay. I just love the soft blanket
        of fog that hangs on the trees across the bay every morning.
        Inside you'll find an ideal space for any vacationing or remotely 
        working family. The decor is darling midcentury casual comfy. The 
        living room is set up for family movie night with a sectional and TV.
        There is a kitchen with a breakfast nook and a separate dining room with 
        a big table. And don't forget the game room to keep the teenagers happy, 
        and a decent toy closet for children. Impress your kids with your old 
        school pac-man skills! Or give them (and you) and break and let them 
        play the Wii-U. Upstairs there are three bedrooms with beds for 8. 
        The pool is heated!!!!
